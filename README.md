Narrative:

The purpose of this project is to create a website for dog lovers around the world that want to provide warm layers for their pets or festive memorabilia for the holidays. The software is supposed to act as an easy access website for customers to buy clothing for their pets. They should be able to shop many generic brands for their pets. Users can view their old orders and see what products they purchased in those orders. A secure checkout should be implemented on the website so that customers can trust that their information is safe with our company. Once the customer has added their desired products into their cart they checkout in a secure checkout on the website. As an admin you can add, update, and delete the products, users, and admins. Admins can also view all orders, completed and in progress, and the products custoemers ordered.
