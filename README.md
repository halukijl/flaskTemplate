Narrative:

The purpose of this project is to create a website for dog lovers around the world that want to provide warm layers for their pets or festive memorabilia for the holidays. The software is supposed to act as an easy access website for customers to buy clothing for their pets. They should be able to shop many generic brands for all shapes and sizes of all pets. Another feature of the site is customers should be able to enter their pet to be an ambassador for the company. If their pet is chosen they get deals throughout the site and free merch to promote the brand, their dogs are also used to show off the products on the website. The software should also keep updated information on stock levels of all products so customers can know which products are available to buy. A secure checkout should be implemented on the website so that customers can trust that their information is safe with our company. The software will also need an area where customers can talk to customer service in case any products arrive damaged or in case customers need to return any products. In the case that any products are sold out or unavailable customers should be able to see recommended products that are similar to the one they were viewing. When it comes to picking sizes there should be a chart linked to each product that helps them decide which size their pet needs. Once the customer has added their desired products into their cart they checkout in a secure checkout on the website. As an admin you can add, update, and delete the products, users, and admins.
